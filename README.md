I thought it would be effective to look at the task as an additional page to the existing website. Therefore, I tried to keep the look clean and simple. Normally, I would load the Make and Model selections as you have on the other pages, but I am limited by CORS and just hardcoded some values. Pagination is accomplished via the "More Videos" button that will display on the bottom of the video listing. The site is fully responsive and will adjust accordingly. Total development time was 11 hours, which is long for such a page, but I think reasonable as I never coded in React before.

UPDATE: 
Took a few more hours to play with React, improved the look, and added some filtering options.
